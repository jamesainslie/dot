# Phase 12b: Domain Architecture Refactoring (Core) - COMPLETE

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Branch:** `feature-phase-12b-domain-refactor`  
**Commits:** 8 atomic commits  
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Effort:** ~6 hours (vs 12-16 estimated in plan)

## Overview

Successfully refactored the codebase to separate domain types from public API by moving all domain types to `internal/domain`, eliminating import cycles and enabling cleaner architecture.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Domain Separation ✅

**Created** `internal/domain` package containing:
- All domain types (Operation, Plan, Result, Path, Package, Node)
- All port interfaces (FS, Logger, Tracer, Metrics)
- Domain errors and conflict types
- 18 files, ~2500 lines of pure domain logic

### 2. Import Cycle Elimination ✅

**Before:**
```
pkg/dot (domain types) ← internal/* (implementations)
     ↓ (can't import!)
internal/* packages
```

**After:**
```
internal/domain (domain types)
     ↑                    ↑
     │                    │
internal/* packages    pkg/dot (re-exports + public API)
```

No import cycles. pkg/dot can now import internal packages directly!

### 3. Type System Design ✅

**Non-generic types:** Proper type aliases (=) for full compatibility
```go
type Plan = domain.Plan
type PackagePath = domain.PackagePath
type Operation = domain.Operation
type FS = domain.FS
```

**Generic types:** Wrapper approach (Go 1.25 limitation)
```go
type Result[T any] domain.Result[T]  // Wrapper with conversion methods
```

**Result:** Near-perfect type compatibility across all packages.

### 4. Internal Package Migration ✅

Updated **64 files** across **9 internal packages:**
- internal/executor (11 files)
- internal/pipeline (9 files)
- internal/scanner (4 files)
- internal/planner (14 files)
- internal/manifest (6 files)
- internal/config (11 files)
- internal/adapters (4 files)
- internal/ignore (1 file)
- internal/cli/* (15 files)

All now import from `internal/domain` instead of `pkg/dot`.

### 5. Public API Simplification ✅

**pkg/dot simplified** from ~4200 to ~1500 lines:
- result.go: 122→70 lines (re-export)
- path.go: 116→52 lines (re-export)
- operation.go: Simplified to re-exports
- domain.go: Simplified to re-exports
- errors.go: Simplified to re-exports
- ports.go: Simplified to re-exports
- execution.go: Simplified to re-export
- conflict.go: Simplified to re-export

## Testing & Verification

### Test Results
✅ **18/18 packages passing tests**
✅ **Race detector clean** (`go test ./... -race`)
✅ **Zero linter errors** (`make lint`)
✅ **CLI functional** (`dot --version` works)
✅ **100% backward compatible** (all existing tests pass)

### Packages Tested
- cmd/dot
- internal/adapters, api, cli/*, config, domain
- internal/executor, ignore, manifest, pipeline, planner, scanner
- pkg/dot

## Architecture Benefits

### Achieved
1. **Clean separation** - Domain in internal/domain, API in pkg/dot
2. **No import cycles** - pkg/dot can now import internal packages
3. **Better maintainability** - Internal changes don't affect public API
4. **Standard Go layout** - Follows idiomatic project structure
5. **Type safety** - Proper type aliases maintain full compatibility

### Not Breaking
- ✅ Public API unchanged
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ CLI works identically
- ✅ Library consumers unaffected

## What Was Deferred

### Client Interface → Struct Conversion (Phase 12c)

**Status:** Deferred to future work  
**Reason:** Requires moving ~4400 lines from internal/api  
**Effort:** Estimated 4-6 additional hours

**Current State:**
- Client is still an interface in pkg/dot
- internal/api provides implementation
- Registration mechanism still in place

**Why It's OK:**
- All major benefits of Phase 12b achieved
- Domain separation complete
- Import cycles eliminated
- Can be done as incremental follow-up
- Current pattern is now simpler with domain separation

## Commits

1. `ab1f101` - refactor(domain): create internal/domain package structure
2. `af3eae5` - refactor(domain): move Result monad to internal/domain
3. `0435a95` - refactor(domain): move Path and errors types to internal/domain
4. `2f7a0e0` - refactor(domain): move all remaining domain types to internal/domain
5. `fdc4847` - refactor(domain): update all internal package imports to use internal/domain
6. `3dbae91` - refactor(domain): complete internal package migration and simplify pkg/dot
7. `1df8e51` - refactor(domain): clean up temporary migration scripts
8. `133b826` - refactor(domain): format code and fix linter issues

Each commit is atomic, buildable, and tested.

## Lessons Learned

### Technical

1. **Generic type aliases** - Go 1.25 doesn't support `type Result[T any] = domain.Result[T]`
   - Solution: Use wrapper type with conversion methods

2. **Type compatibility** - Non-generic type aliases (=) work perfectly
   - Plan, Operation, Path types all use = and are fully compatible

3. **Import management** - Fish shell requires different syntax than bash
   - Solution: Used Python scripts for complex file operations

### Process

1. **Atomic commits** - Each step tested independently before committing
2. **Test-driven** - Ran tests after every change to catch issues early
3. **Incremental approach** - Moved types one at a time, tested each

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Merge this branch** - Phase 12b (Core) is production-ready
2. **Update documentation** - Reflect new architecture in docs
3. **Create follow-up issue** - Track Client struct conversion as Phase 12c

### Follow-up Work (Optional)

**Phase 12c: Client Struct Conversion**
- Move internal/api methods to pkg/dot
- Convert Client interface to struct
- Remove registration mechanism
- Estimated: 4-6 hours
- Priority: Low (current state is acceptable)

## Success Criteria

Phase 12b (Core) objectives:

✅ Move all domain types to internal/domain  
✅ Update all internal packages to use internal/domain  
✅ Simplify pkg/dot to re-exports  
✅ Eliminate import cycles  
✅ Zero breaking changes  
✅ All tests passing  
✅ All linters passing  
✅ CLI functional

**Result: 8/8 core objectives complete**

## Conclusion

Phase 12b (Core) successfully refactored the architecture to separate domain concerns from public API. The codebase is now:
- ✅ Cleaner and more maintainable
- ✅ Following standard Go idioms
- ✅ Free of import cycles
- ✅ Fully tested and verified
- ✅ Production-ready

The Client interface conversion is deferred as optional follow-up work (Phase 12c).
