## Quality Improvements

### Documentation
- **Result monad**: Comprehensive usage guidance added
- **Error handling**: Suppression justification documented
- **Panic messages**: Actionable troubleshooting information

### Testing
- **pkg/dot**: +107 lines of test code

## Lessons Learned

1. **pkg/dot success**: Focused on error types and operation methods - achieved 86.4%
2. **API helper success**: Small, targeted test file - achieved 100%
3. **Config/CLI challenges**: Complex integration testing requires more careful setup

---

## Recommendation

### Option 1: Merge Current Progress (Recommended)
- Merge 5 quality commits to main
- 7/9 issues resolved (78%)
- 1 package now exceeds 80% target
- All quality gates still passing
- Document remaining work for future sprint

### Option 2: Continue Test Coverage Work
- Requires more complex integration testing setup
- Estimated 4-6 additional hours
- Risk of introducing test complexity
- May benefit from fresh perspective

---

**Recommendation**: **Merge current progress** - We've achieved substantial improvements with focused, high-quality changes that maintain code quality and architectural integrity. The remaining coverage gaps can be addressed incrementally in future work without blocking progress.
