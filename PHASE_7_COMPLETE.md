# Phase 7 Complete: Functional Core - Resolver

## Overview

Phase 7 implements pure conflict detection and resolution logic for the dot CLI. The resolver analyzes planned operations, detects conflicts with current filesystem state, applies resolution policies, and generates actionable suggestions for users.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 7.1: Core Conflict Types and Detection
**Commits**: 3 atomic commits
- Defined 6 conflict types (FileExists, WrongLink, Permission, Circular, DirExpected, FileExpected)

- Created CurrentState representation (Files, Links, Dirs maps)
- Implemented conflict detection for LinkCreate and DirCreate operations

**Key Types**:
```go
type ConflictType int // 6 variants
type Conflict struct  // With path, details, context, suggestions
type ResolutionStatus int // 4 variants  
type ResolutionOutcome struct // Per-operation result
type ResolveResult struct // Aggregated results

```

### Task 7.2: Resolution Policies
**Commits**: 1 atomic commit
- Defined 4 resolution policies (Fail, Backup, Overwrite, Skip)

## Design Principles Followed

### Pure Functions
All resolver logic is side-effect-free. The resolver:
- Takes operations and current state as input
- Returns ResolveResult with conflicts and warnings
- Does not modify filesystem or external state
- Enables testing without mocks

### Fail-Safe Defaults
All resolution policies default to `PolicyFail`:
- Prevents accidental data loss
- Forces explicit policy configuration for risky operations
- Users must opt-in to destructive behaviors

### Actionable Feedback
Every conflict includes 2-3 concrete suggestions:
- Specific commands with examples
- Clear explanations of why each option helps
- Multiple resolution paths for different user preferences

### Comprehensive Error Collection
Resolver collects all conflicts rather than fail-fast:
- Users see all problems at once
- Enables batch resolution decisions
- Better user experience than incremental error discovery

### Type Safety
Leverages phantom types for compile-time safety:
- FilePath types prevent path mixing
- Operation types ensure correct handling
- Result monad for clean error propagation

## Architecture

### Resolver Pipeline

```
Operations + CurrentState + Policies
    ↓
resolveOperation (dispatcher)
    ↓
Operation-specific resolution (resolveLinkCreate, resolveDirCreate)
    ↓
detectConflicts (detectLinkCreateConflicts, detectDirCreateConflicts)
    ↓
applyPolicy (applyFailPolicy, applySkipPolicy, etc.)
    ↓
enrichConflictWithSuggestions
    ↓
ResolveResult (operations, conflicts, warnings)
```

### Data Flow

```
DesiredState
    ↓
ComputeOperationsFromDesiredState
    ↓
[]Operation
    ↓
Resolve(operations, current, policies)
    ↓
PlanResult{Desired, Resolved}
```

## Key Features

### Conflict Detection
- File exists at target location
- Symlink points to wrong source
- Permission denied errors
- Circular symlink dependencies
- Directory/file type mismatches

### Resolution Policies
- **Fail**: Stop and report (default, safest)
- **Skip**: Continue with warning
- **Backup**: Move conflicting file (future)
- **Overwrite**: Replace conflicting file (future)

### Suggestion System
- Context-aware suggestions per conflict type
- Command examples for each suggestion
- Clear explanations of trade-offs
- Multiple resolution paths

### Integration Points
- PlanResult for planning pipeline
- ResolveResult for conflict reporting
- CurrentState for filesystem representation
- ResolutionPolicies for configuration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Each conflict type tested independently
- Each resolution policy tested in isolation
- Each suggestion generator tested per conflict type
- Conflict enrichment verified

### Integration Tests
- Complete resolution workflow tested
- Multiple conflicts aggregated correctly
- Policy application with different configurations
- Mixed operation types handled properly

### Edge Cases Covered
- Empty operation lists
- All operations conflict
- Mixed conflict types
- Skipped vs failed operations
- Already-correct symlinks

## Performance Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is number of operations
- **Space Complexity**: O(c + w) where c is conflicts, w is warnings
- **No Allocations**: Minimal heap allocations through preallocation
- **Pure Functions**: Enables parallelization in future phases

## Future Enhancements

Phase 7 provides foundation for future resolver improvements:

### Pending Operation Types
- FileDelete operation (needed for PolicyOverwrite)
- FileRename operation (for conflict resolution)
- These will enable full implementation of Backup and Overwrite policies

### Advanced Resolution
- Interactive conflict resolution
- Smart merge for specific file types
- Three-way merge support
- Custom resolver plugins

### Enhanced Suggestions
- Machine learning-based suggestions
- Context from past resolutions
- User preference learning
- Conflict pattern detection

## Dependencies

**Requires**:
- Phase 1: Domain Model (Path types, Result monad, Operation types)
- Phase 6: Functional Core - Planner (DesiredState)

**Enables**:
- Phase 8: Topological Sorter (operates on resolved operations)
- Phase 9: Pipeline Orchestration (uses ResolveResult)
- Phase 10: Imperative Shell - Executor (consumes resolved plan)

## Standards Compliance

### Test-Driven Development
- All tests written before implementation
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed
- 100% test pass rate maintained

### Code Quality
- All linters pass (golangci-lint v2)
- All formatters applied (goimports, gofmt)
- Coverage above 79% (target: 80%)

### Atomic Commits

- All commits leave codebase in working state
- Conventional Commits specification followed
- Meaningful commit messages with context

### Functional Programming

## Lessons Learned

1. **Phantom Types Work Well**: FilePath vs TargetPath distinction caught type errors at compile time
2. **Pure Functions Enable Testing**: No mocks needed for resolver logic
3. **Fail-Safe Defaults Critical**: PolicyFail default prevents data loss
4. **Suggestions Improve UX**: Context-aware suggestions guide users effectively
5. **Preallocation Matters**: Linter caught optimization opportunity

## Next Steps

**Phase 8: Functional Core - Topological Sorter**
- Implement dependency graph construction
- Add topological sort algorithm
- Detect circular dependencies
- Compute parallelization plans

The resolver provides the foundation for safe conflict handling throughout the stow/unstow/restow/adopt workflows.
