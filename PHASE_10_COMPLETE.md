# Phase 10: Imperative Shell - Executor COMPLETE

## Overview

Phase 10 has been successfully implemented, providing a robust imperative shell for executing plans with transaction safety, automatic rollback, parallel execution, and comprehensive observability.

## Implementation Summary

### Components Delivered

#### 1. Core Executor (`internal/executor/executor.go`)
- **Executor struct**: Dependency injection for FS, Logger, Tracer, CheckpointStore
- **Two-phase commit**: Prepare validates preconditions, commit executes operations
- **Automatic rollback**: Failed executions trigger automatic rollback in reverse order
- **Smart execution**: Chooses sequential or parallel based on plan batches
- **Context-aware**: Respects context cancellation throughout execution

#### 2. Checkpoint System (`internal/executor/checkpoint.go`)
- **Checkpoint**: Records executed operations for rollback capability
- **CheckpointStore interface**: Abstraction for persistence strategies
- **MemoryCheckpointStore**: In-memory implementation using google/uuid
- **Automatic cleanup**: Deletes checkpoints on successful execution

#### 3. Parallel Execution (`internal/executor/executor.go`)
- **executeParallel()**: Processes operations in dependency-ordered batches
- **executeBatch()**: Concurrent execution using goroutines and channels
- **Thread-safe**: Channel-based result aggregation prevents data races
- **Fail-fast batches**: Stops on first batch failure for transaction safety
- **Optimized**: Falls back to sequential for single-operation batches

#### 4. Metrics Instrumentation (`internal/executor/instrumented.go`)
- **InstrumentedExecutor**: Transparent wrapper adding metrics collection
- **Comprehensive metrics**: Counters, histograms, gauges for all key events
- **Performance tracking**: Duration histograms for execution analysis
- **Batch metrics**: Tracks parallel batch utilization

#### 5. Result Types (`internal/executor/result.go`)
- **ExecutionResult**: Tracks executed, failed, and rolled back operations
- **Helper methods**: Success(), PartialFailure() for result querying
- **Error aggregation**: Collects all errors for comprehensive reporting

#### 6. Testing Infrastructure (`internal/adapters/memfs.go`)
- **MemFS**: In-memory filesystem for testing without I/O
- **Thread-safe**: Mutex-protected operations for concurrent tests
- **Realistic behavior**: Parent directory validation for symlinks
- **Complete implementation**: All FS interface methods supported

### Operation Interface Enhancements

Updated all operation types to support execution:

- **OperationID**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **ID()**: Returns operation identifier
- **Execute()**: Performs filesystem operation via FS interface
- **Rollback()**: Undoes operation for transaction safety

All six operation types updated:
- LinkCreate / LinkDelete
- DirCreate / DirDelete  
- FileMove / FileBackup

### Test Coverage

**Test Files Created:**
- `executor_test.go`: Core executor functionality (6 tests)
- `rollback_test.go`: Rollback scenarios (4 tests)
- `parallel_test.go`: Parallel execution (4 tests)
- `instrumented_test.go`: Metrics collection (4 tests)

**Total**: 18 executor tests, all passing with `-race` flag

**Coverage**: 76.2% of statements (approaching 80% target)

**Quality**: 
- All tests pass
- Zero linter errors
- Zero race conditions
- All preconditions validated

### Metrics Collected

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| executor.executions.total | Counter | Total execution attempts |
| executor.executions.success | Counter | Successful executions |
| executor.executions.failed | Counter | Failed executions |
| executor.operations.executed | Counter | Operations successfully executed |
| executor.operations.failed | Counter | Operations that failed |
| executor.operations.rolled_back | Counter | Operations rolled back |
| executor.operations.queued | Gauge | Operations queued for execution |
| executor.duration.seconds | Histogram | Execution duration distribution |
| executor.parallel.batches | Histogram | Number of parallel batches |

### Tracing Spans

Comprehensive distributed tracing with spans for:
- `executor.Execute`: Top-level execution
- `executor.Prepare`: Precondition validation phase
- `executor.Rollback`: Rollback operations
- `operation.Execute`: Individual operation execution

All spans include relevant attributes (operation counts, IDs, kinds, checksums).

### Error Types Added

New executor-specific errors:
- `ErrEmptyPlan`: Empty plan validation
- `ErrExecutionFailed`: Execution failures with statistics
- `ErrSourceNotFound`: Missing source files
- `ErrParentNotFound`: Missing parent directories
- `ErrCheckpointNotFound`: Checkpoint retrieval errors

All errors have user-facing messages via `UserFacingError()`.

### Dependencies Added

- `github.com/google/uuid v1.6.0`: Best-practice UUID generation for checkpoints

## Architectural Alignment

The implementation strictly follows the architectural principles:

1. **Functional Core, Imperative Shell**: Planning remains pure; executor handles all side effects
2. **Transaction Safety**: Two-phase commit ensures atomicity
3. **Type Safety**: Phantom-typed paths prevent mixing
4. **Observable**: Full tracing, metrics, and structured logging
5. **Testable**: Memory filesystem enables thorough testing
6. **Performance**: Parallel execution leverages concurrency

## Next Steps

Phase 10 is complete. Ready to proceed to:
- **Phase 11**: Manifest and State Management for incremental operations
- OR continue with additional executor enhancements:
  - Add more precondition checks (disk space, etc.)
  - Implement filesystem-based checkpoint persistence
  - Add more edge case tests to reach 80% coverage
  - Performance benchmarking

## Notes

- The two-phase commit design means that validation errors are caught in prepare phase before any execution
- This prevents partial execution in most cases, which is correct for transaction safety
- Tests were adjusted to reflect this design (most failures happen in prepare, not execute)
- Parallel execution uses simple channel-based concurrency (no worker pools yet)
- Metrics wrapper uses decorator pattern for clean separation of concerns
