# Phase 8: Functional Core - Topological Sorter - COMPLETE

## Overview

Phase 8 has been successfully completed following constitutional principles: test-driven development, pure functional programming, and efficient graph algorithms. The topological sorter enables safe operation ordering and parallel execution planning by analyzing dependencies and detecting cycles.

## Deliverables

### 8.1 Dependency Graph ✅
**Status**: Complete with comprehensive graph operations

Implemented dependency graph construction and queries:

**DependencyGraph Structure**:
- Maps operations to indices for quick lookup
- Stores operations in insertion order
- Maintains edges representing dependencies
- Immutable once constructed

**Core Functions**:
- `BuildGraph(ops)`: Constructs graph from operations
- `Size()`: Returns number of operations
- `HasOperation(op)`: Checks if operation exists
- `Dependencies(op)`: Returns dependencies for operation
- `Operations()`: Returns all operations (copy)

**Algorithm**:
- Time complexity: O(n + e) for n operations, e dependencies
- Space complexity: O(n + e)
- Safe concurrent access (returns copies)

### 8.2 Topological Sort ✅
**Status**: Complete with cycle detection

Implemented DFS-based topological sorting:

**TopologicalSort Function**:
```go
func (g *DependencyGraph) TopologicalSort() ([]dot.Operation, error)
```

**Algorithm**:
- Depth-first search with post-order traversal
- Checks for cycles before sorting
- Returns operations in dependency order
- Dependencies always appear before dependents

**Cycle Detection**:
- Detects all types of cycles (self-loops, multi-node cycles)
- Returns complete cycle path for error reporting
- Uses recursion stack tracking to identify back edges

**FindCycle Function**:
```go
func (g *DependencyGraph) FindCycle() []dot.Operation
```

**Features**:
- Returns nil if no cycle exists
- Returns complete cycle path if found
- Formats cycle as [A→B→C→A] for clarity
- Handles self-loops and complex cycles

### 8.3 Parallelization Analysis ✅
**Status**: Complete with level-based batching

Implemented parallelization planning:

**ParallelizationPlan Function**:
```go
func (g *DependencyGraph) ParallelizationPlan() [][]dot.Operation
```

**Algorithm**:
- Level-based grouping with memoization
- Level 0: Operations with no dependencies
- Level N: Operations depending only on levels < N
- Operations at same level can run concurrently

**Safety Guarantees**:
- No operation in a batch depends on another in same batch
- All dependencies in earlier batches
- Batches must execute sequentially
- Maximizes parallelization opportunities

**Performance**:
- Time complexity: O(n + e)
- Memoization prevents recomputation
- Minimal memory allocation

## Pure Functional Design

All sorter functions are pure:
- No side effects
- Deterministic output for given input
- No global state
- Composable
- Testable without mocks

**Example**:
```go
// Pure function - same input always produces same output
graph := BuildGraph(operations)
sorted, err := graph.TopologicalSort()
batches := graph.ParallelizationPlan()
```

## Quality Metrics

## Key Achievements

1. **Efficient Algorithms**: O(n + e) complexity for all operations
2. **Cycle Detection**: Prevents execution of impossible dependency chains
3. **Parallelization**: Maximizes concurrent execution opportunities
4. **Safety**: Guarantees all dependencies satisfied before execution
5. **Immutability**: Returns copies to prevent external mutation
6. **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage with edge cases

## Algorithm Details

### Topological Sort (Kahn's variation using DFS)

1. Check for cycles (fail early)
2. Initialize visited set
3. DFS post-order traversal:
   - Visit all dependencies first
   - Mark node as visited
   - Add to result
4. Result is in dependency order

**Correctness**: For any edge A→B, B appears before A in result

### Cycle Detection

1. Initialize visited and recursion stack
2. DFS with back-edge detection:
   - Mark node as in recursion stack
   - Visit dependencies
   - If dependency in stack → cycle found
   - Remove from stack after processing
3. Reconstruct cycle path using parent pointers

**Correctness**: Detects all cycles in directed graphs

### Parallelization Planning

1. Compute level for each operation:
   - Level 0: No dependencies
   - Level N: max(dep levels) + 1
2. Group operations by level
3. Return as ordered batches

**Correctness**: Operations in same batch have no dependencies on each other

## Performance Characteristics

**BuildGraph**:
- Time: O(n + e)
- Space: O(n + e)

**TopologicalSort**:
- Time: O(n + e) for cycle check + O(n + e) for sort
- Space: O(n) for visited sets + O(n) for result

**ParallelizationPlan**:
- Time: O(n + e) with memoization
- Space: O(n) for level maps

**Overall**: All operations linear in graph size

## Integration Points

**Consumes**:
- Phase 6 (Planner): Operations from desired state
- Phase 7 (Resolver): Resolved operations

**Produces**:
- Sorted operations for sequential execution
- Parallel batches for concurrent execution
- Cycle errors for impossible plans

**Used By**:
- Phase 9 (Pipeline): Sort stage in pipeline
- Phase 10 (Executor): Parallel execution scheduling

## Edge Cases Handled

- Empty operation lists
- Single operations
- Self-loops (A→A)
- Two-node cycles (A→B→A)
- Long cycles (A→B→C→...→A)
- Multiple disconnected components
- Diamond dependencies
- Complex DAGs with 100+ nodes

## Next Steps

Phase 8 provides operation ordering. **Phase 9: Pipeline Orchestration** composes all functional stages:

**Phase 9** will implement:
- Generic Pipeline[A, B] composition
- Stow, Unstow, Restow, Adopt pipelines
- Pipeline engine with observability
- Integration tests
