## Review Dimensions

The system evaluates code across seven dimensions:

### 1. Constitutional Compliance
- **Test-First Development**: TDD adherence, coverage thresholds
- **Atomic Commits**: Conventional commits, proper versioning
- **Functional Programming**: Pure functions, minimal state
- **Technology Stack**: Approved dependencies only
- **Documentation Standard**: Academic style, no emojis
- **Quality Gates**: Linting, complexity limits

### 2. Architectural Compliance
- **Layer Separation**: Domain, API, CLI boundaries
- **Functional Core, Imperative Shell**: Side effect isolation
- **Type Safety**: Phantom types, interface adherence

### 3. Code Quality
- **Error Handling**: Explicit handling, proper wrapping
- **Function Design**: Size limits, single responsibility
- **Code Smells**: Duplication, complexity, magic numbers

### 4. Testing Quality
- **Coverage**: 80% minimum requirement
- **Test Design**: Table-driven, isolated, descriptive
- **Integration**: Complete test fixtures

### 5. Security
- **Input Validation**: Path traversal, sanitization
- **File Operations**: Permissions, temporary files
- **Credentials**: No hardcoding, secure storage
- **Dependencies**: Version pinning, vulnerability scanning

### 6. Documentation
- **Code**: Godoc completeness, comment quality
- **Project**: README accuracy, up-to-date examples

### 7. Performance
- **Memory**: Preallocation, leak prevention
- **Algorithms**: Appropriate data structures

- Documentation gaps for public APIs
- Breaking changes

**Action**: Fix in current sprint

### MEDIUM (Improve When Possible)
- Code smells
- Performance concerns
- Non-critical documentation gaps
- Refactoring opportunities

**Action**: Incorporate into regular workflow

### LOW (Optional Improvements)
- Style inconsistencies
- Import organization
- Minor documentation updates
- Comment improvements

**Action**: Fix opportunistically

## AI Remediation Prompts

Each issue includes a self-contained AI prompt that:
- Provides complete context
- Specifies exact changes needed
- Includes verification steps
- References relevant standards
- Can be copy-pasted directly to AI agent

**Example Usage**:
1. Run review command
2. Open generated report
3. Find critical issue
4. Copy AI Remediation Prompt section
5. Paste into new Cursor chat
6. AI implements fix
7. Follow verification steps
8. Commit changes

## Workflow Integration

### Pre-Commit Review
```bash
# Review your changes
/review cmd/dot/manage.go internal/api/manage.go

# Fix identified issues
# Commit clean code
```

### Pre-PR Review
```bash
# Full review before PR
/review full

# Address all CRITICAL issues
# Address HIGH priority issues
# Create PR with clean bill of health
```

### Release Review
```bash
# Comprehensive review
/review full

# Zero CRITICAL issues required
# Minimal HIGH issues acceptable
# Document any known MEDIUM issues
```

### Regular Reviews
```bash
# Weekly review for active development
/review full

# Track quality trends over time
# Compare reports to measure improvement
```

## Quality Score

Overall quality calculated as:

```
Base: 10.0 points

Deductions:
- CRITICAL issue: -1.0 point each
- HIGH issue: -0.3 points each
- MEDIUM issue: -0.1 points each
- LOW issues: no deduction

Coverage < 80%: -0.5 points
Coverage < 70%: -1.0 points
Linting failures: -0.5 points

Target: ≥ 8.0 points
```

## Getting Started

### First Review

1. Run initial review:
   ```bash
   /review full
   ```

2. Review generated report:
   ```bash
   open reviews/code-review-YYYY-MM-DD_HHmmss.md
   ```

3. Prioritize issues:
   - Start with CRITICAL
   - Then HIGH
   - Group MEDIUM issues
   - Defer LOW issues

4. Use AI prompts:
   - Copy remediation prompt
   - Paste into Cursor
   - Let AI implement fix
   - Verify changes

5. Re-run review:
   ```bash
   /review full
   ```

6. Track improvement

### Iterative Improvement

1. Fix CRITICAL issues first
2. Address HIGH issues before new features
3. Batch MEDIUM issues for efficiency
4. Apply LOW fixes during related work
5. Maintain quality score ≥ 8.0

## Best Practices

### Do

- Run reviews regularly
- Fix CRITICAL issues immediately
- Use AI remediation prompts
- Track quality over time
- Compare reports to measure progress
- Integrate reviews into workflow
- Keep reports for historical analysis
- Focus on high-impact issues first

### Don't

- Ignore CRITICAL issues
- Try to fix everything at once
- Skip verification steps
- Commit with known CRITICAL issues
- Rush through remediation
- Ignore constitutional violations
- Let quality score drop below 8.0
- Create PRs with unaddressed CRITICAL issues

## Maintenance

### Report Retention

- **Active development**: Keep all reports
- **Last 3 months**: Weekly reports
- **Historical**: Milestone reports only

### System Updates

Review system will evolve to:
- Add new detection rules
- Improve AI prompts
- Enhance report formatting
- Support new review dimensions

Check command file for version information.

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics across reviews:

1. **Quality Score**: Trending upward toward 10.0
2. **Test Coverage**: Consistently ≥ 80%
3. **Critical Issues**: Zero in production branches
4. **High Issues**: Decreasing trend
5. **Time to Fix**: Faster resolution of issues
6. **False Positives**: Minimal and documented

## Support

### Documentation

**Solution**: Focus on CRITICAL first, batch others

**Issue**: AI prompt doesn't work
**Solution**: Check context, run verification steps

**Issue**: False positives
**Solution**: Document justification, update criteria

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:

1. **Historical tracking**: Quality trend visualization
2. **CI integration**: Automated review in pipeline
3. **Custom rules**: Project-specific checks
4. **Batch execution**: Automated remediation for simple issues
5. **Report comparison**: Diff between review runs
6. **Team metrics**: Aggregate quality across contributors

## Conclusion

The code review system provides comprehensive quality analysis aligned with project constitutional principles. It identifies issues, explains their impact, and provides AI-executable solutions for efficient remediation.

Use regularly to maintain high code quality, ensure architectural integrity, and uphold project standards.
