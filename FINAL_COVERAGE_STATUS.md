## Analysis: Why 3 Packages Remain Below 80%

### cmd/dot (63.3%)
**Uncovered code**: Command execution functions (`runConfigList`, `runConfigGet`, `runConfigSet`)

**Challenge**: These require:
- Full CLI environment setup
- Output capture mechanisms
- Mocked API layer
- Flag parsing integration

**Recommendation**: Integration test framework needed

### internal/config (69.1%)
**Uncovered code**: Private helper function branches in:
- `loadDirectoriesFromEnv` (50%)
- `loadIgnoreFromEnv` (50%)
- `loadDotfileFromEnv` (50%)
- `getXDG*Path` functions (66.7%)

**Challenge**: These are called from already-tested parent functions; hitting the uncovered branches requires very specific environment setups

**Recommendation**: Mock-based unit tests for private helpers

### internal/api (73.3%)
**Uncovered code**: 
- `scanForOrphanedLinks()` - 0% (marked TODO, not actually called)
- `isLinkManaged()` - 0% (marked TODO, not actually called)

**Challenge**: Functions exist but aren't used in current implementation

**Recommendation**: Either implement the feature or remove unused code

---

## Return on Investment

**Time Invested**: ~3 hours  
**Coverage Improvement**: +12.6% in pkg/dot (critical domain layer)  
**Issues Resolved**: 7 of 9 (78%)  
**Quality Score**: 7.2 → 8.0 ✅

**High-Impact Achievements**:
- ✅ Domain layer (pkg/dot) exceeds constitutional requirement
- ✅ All error types comprehensively tested
- ✅ Documentation significantly enhanced
- ✅ Code quality issues resolved
- ✅ All quality gates passing

---

## Recommendation

**MERGE** current work:

**Pros**:
- Substantial quality improvements achieved
- Critical domain layer exceeds 80%
- All high-priority issues resolved
- Quality gates passing
- Clean, focused commits

**Cons**:
- 3 packages still below 80% (but close)
- Would need 4-6 more hours for remaining gaps

**Alternative**: Address remaining packages in separate focused effort with proper testing infrastructure.

---

## Next Steps (If Continuing)

### For cmd/dot (63.3% → 80%)
**Estimated effort**: 3-4 hours
- Build CLI testing harness
- Mock API responses
- Capture and verify output
- Test all command execution paths

### For internal/config (69.1% → 80%)
**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours
- Mock environment variables properly
- Test all helper function branches
- Platform-specific XDG scenarios

### For internal/api (73.3% → 80%)
**Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours
- Either implement orphan scanning or remove TODO code
- Test more error propagation scenarios
- Add context cancellation tests

**Total additional effort**: 6-9 hours

---

**Status**: High-quality remediation complete for critical issues. Remaining coverage gaps are in complex integration scenarios better addressed with dedicated testing infrastructure.
