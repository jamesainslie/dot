- Verify and maintain 80% test coverage threshold
- Validate property-based tests with high iteration counts
- Complete comprehensive security audit

### Tasks

#### 20.1.1: Linter Suite Execution
```bash
# Run complete linter suite
make lint

# Verify specific linters
golangci-lint run --config .golangci.yml --verbose

# Check for specific issue categories
golangci-lint run --enable-all --disable=... --verbose
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Run golangci-lint with full linter configuration
- [ ] Verify contextcheck (context parameter validation)
- [ ] Verify copyloopvar (loop variable capture)
- [ ] Verify depguard (prohibited dependency check)
- [ ] Verify dupl (code duplication detection)
- [ ] Verify gocritic (comprehensive style checks)
- [ ] Verify gocyclo (cyclomatic complexity ≤ 15)
- [ ] Verify gosec (security issues, excluding G104, G301, G302, G304)
- [ ] Verify importas (import naming consistency)
- [ ] Verify misspell (spelling errors)
- [ ] Verify nakedret (naked return detection)

- Group related fixes into atomic commits
- Use conventional commit messages for each fix
- Run tests after each fix to ensure no regressions

#### 20.1.2: Test Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate coverage report
make coverage

# View coverage by package
go tool cover -func=coverage.out

# Generate HTML coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Check coverage threshold
go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//'
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Generate coverage report for entire codebase
- [ ] Verify overall coverage ≥ 80%
- [ ] Identify packages below threshold
- [ ] Review uncovered code for test gaps
- [ ] Add tests for critical uncovered paths
- [ ] Add tests for error handling paths
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases
- [ ] Document intentionally untested code (if any)

- `internal/ignore/`: ≥ 80% (pattern matching)
- `cmd/dot/`: ≥ 75% (CLI layer)

#### 20.1.3: Property-Based Test Validation
```bash
# Run property tests with high iteration count
go test -v ./test/properties/... -gopter.iterations=10000

# Run with extended timeout
go test -v ./test/properties/... -gopter.iterations=50000 -timeout=30m

# Run with various seeds for reproducibility
go test -v ./test/properties/... -gopter.seed=12345
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Run all property tests with 10,000 iterations
- [ ] Run critical properties with 50,000 iterations
- [ ] Verify idempotence properties (manage then manage)
- [ ] Verify reversibility properties (manage then unmanage)
- [ ] Verify commutativity properties (package order independence)

- [ ] Verify consistency properties (manifest accuracy)
- [ ] Test with multiple random seeds
- [ ] Document any property violations discovered
- [ ] Fix any property violations before release
- [ ] Add regression tests for violations
- [ ] Verify properties pass in CI

**Property Test Categories**:
1. Algebraic Laws: idempotence, reversibility, commutativity, associativity
2. Domain Invariants: path safety, graph acyclicity, manifest consistency
3. Error Handling: propagation completeness, rollback correctness
4. Performance: algorithmic complexity bounds

#### 20.1.4: Security Audit
```bash
# Run security scanner
gosec -conf .gosec.yml ./...

# Check for known vulnerabilities
go list -json -m all | nancy sleuth

go mod verify
go mod tidy
```

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Run gosec security scanner
- [ ] Review all security findings

- [ ] Document false positives with justification
- [ ] Run nancy for dependency vulnerabilities
- [ ] Run govulncheck for known Go vulnerabilities
- [ ] Update vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Verify no hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Verify proper input validation
- [ ] Verify safe path handling (no traversal attacks)
- [ ] Verify proper permission checks
- [ ] Verify safe symlink creation (no arbitrary writes)
- [ ] Review error messages for information disclosure
- [ ] Verify safe defaults (fail-safe conflict resolution)
- [ ] Document security considerations in README
- [ ] Create SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting process

**Security Focus Areas**:
1. Path validation: prevent directory traversal
2. Input sanitization: validate all user input
3. Symlink safety: prevent arbitrary file access
4. Permission checks: respect filesystem ACLs
5. Credential handling: no secrets in logs/errors
6. Dependency security: no known vulnerabilities

#### 20.1.5: Code Quality Metrics
**Checklist**:
- [ ] Verify cyclomatic complexity ≤ 15 for all functions

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Platform-specific bugs discovered late  
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive cross-platform testing early; maintain test matrix; use CI matrix builds

**Risk**: Performance issues at scale  
**Mitigation**: Property-based tests with large inputs; benchmark critical paths; test with large package sets

**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in dependencies  
**Mitigation**: Regular security scans; minimal dependencies; automated vulnerability checks in CI

### Process Risks

**Risk**: Documentation gaps discovered post-release  
**Mitigation**: Peer review of documentation; test examples; validate against actual usage

**Risk**: Installation failures on specific platforms  
**Mitigation**: Test installations on real systems; provide troubleshooting guide; collect user feedback

**Risk**: Release automation failures  
**Mitigation**: Test goreleaser locally; dry-run releases; validate artifacts before publication

---

## Rollback Plan

### Minor Issues
1. Document workarounds in GitHub Issues
2. Plan patch release (v0.1.1)

### Major Issues
1. Mark release as "not recommended" on GitHub
2. Create hotfix branch from v0.1.0 tag
3. Implement and test fix
4. Release v0.1.1 immediately
5. Update all distribution channels
6. Post announcement about recommended upgrade

### Critical Security Issues
1. Immediately mark release as "not recommended"
